# Professional README Generator 

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Description

This is a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4) and Node.js v16. The readme file consists of sections such as title, description, table of contents, installation, usage, contributing guidelines, tests and questions. For the readme to be generated the user must input information in the command-line based on the prompts, which structure the markdown file. Included in the repository files are the two javascript files index.js (main) and generateMarkdown.js. Also inside is a Package.json for metadata and dependencies, which allow package managers like `npm init` to install. See installation and usage for proper use of the application. This application is built for the purpose of making professional readme's for new upcoming projects.
